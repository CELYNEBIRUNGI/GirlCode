    <h1>Understanding Credit Scores</h1>
    <p>
    Build and maintain a healthy credit score:
    Pay all bills, loans, and credit card payments on time to establish a positive payment history.
    Keep credit card balances low, ideally below 30% of your available credit limit.
    Avoid applying for multiple new credit accounts within a short period, as it can negatively impact your credit score.
    Regularly review your credit report for errors and dispute any inaccuracies with the credit bureaus.
    Establish good credit habits:
    Consider opening a secured credit card or becoming an authorized user to build credit if you have a limited credit history.
    Diversify your credit mix by having a combination of credit cards, loans, and other types of credit.
    Use credit responsibly and only borrow what you can afford to repay.
    Avoid closing old credit accounts, as it may shorten your credit history and impact your credit score negatively.
