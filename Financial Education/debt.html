    <h1>Debt Management Strategies</h1>
    <p>
Prioritize and organize your debts:
List all your debts, including balances, interest rates, and minimum monthly payments.
Consider the debt snowball method: Pay off debts starting with the smallest balance first, while continuing to make minimum payments on other debts.
Alternatively, use the debt avalanche method: Focus on the debt with the highest interest rate first, while making minimum payments on other debts.
Negotiate with creditors:
Contact your creditors to negotiate lower interest rates, extended payment terms, or debt settlement options.
Explain your financial situation honestly and provide evidence of financial hardship, if applicable.
Seek professional credit counseling assistance if necessary to negotiate with creditors on your behalf.
Avoid falling into debt traps:
Create a realistic budget to manage your expenses and avoid overspending.
Build an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses and avoid relying on credit cards.
Develop frugal habits, such as reducing discretionary spending, cooking at home, and finding free or low-cost entertainment options.
